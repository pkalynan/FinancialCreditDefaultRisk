# Credit_Risk_Code__
Project for Academic Higher Education: continues for two courses. Data set given - uses the CRISP-DM methodology. One of two models are used in this code.
It would be unnecessary to load too many libraries into modelling. Processes were deemed as appropriate with no need to overemphasize coding and no need to be overly technical as this academic project focuses on the statistics/math and business more than the technical coding aspect.
